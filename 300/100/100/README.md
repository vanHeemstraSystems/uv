# 100 - Installing uv

Based on [Installing uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

## PyPI
For convenience, uv is published to PyPI.

If installing from PyPI, we recommend installing uv into an isolated environment, e.g., with pipx:

```
pipx install uv
```

However, pip can also be used:

```
pip install uv
```
